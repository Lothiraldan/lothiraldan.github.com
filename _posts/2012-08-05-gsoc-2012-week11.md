Eleventh week of work of GSOC, bug fixes, bug fixes and bug fixes.

Ticket 4685
-----------

[Ticket 4685](http://www.logilab.org/ticket/4685) is about handling \_\_all\_\_ in pylint. With the ticket fix, pylint will not warn you about unused import when it is used in \_\_all\_\_. It will also warn you if you reference a bad name in \_\_all\_\_, which would result in an error on global import.

Ticket 83749
------------

[Ticket 83749](https://www.logilab.org/ticket/83749). Same ticket than last week, but it's now fixed. With python-3k compatibility, pylint is more and more usable with python-3k and its new features.

Json reporter
-------------

With the release in target at the end of GSOC, goatlog is more and more ready to be released. Next week, more tests on exceptions and lot of documentation.

See you next week for new adventures.
