The ACC is going well, lot of interesting people to talk to, lot of interesting projects to discover and lot of intersting to do.

What we did since two days:

> -   Review of the code I wrote last week.
> -   Marmoute read the midterm summary.
> -   How do we handle messaging (data api).
> -   Update caprine runner.
> -   Miss the friday meeting (sorry Yeswanth!).
> -   Eat sausages.

What we planned to do this week-end:

> -   Define what we exactly want for the end of the GSoC  
>     -   listen to events coming from pypi
>     -   read info from setup.cfg
>     -   format messages and push them in a queue
>     -   pick up the messages in the queue in the different slaves
>     -   dispatch the messages to the â‰  VMs
>     -   define a recipe which is able to use tasks and other recipes (subrecipes)
>     -   run recipes
>     -   get back information about the tasks (data API)
>     -   send structured information into a predefined format (json, but how?)
>     -   keep track of VM status
>     -   have a nice high API to manage VMs
>
> -   Install and test the overall system
> -   Have feedback about the article

We didn't write a lot of code, but we manage to agree on Raw Data API (How we handle messaging.), it's a great step done.
