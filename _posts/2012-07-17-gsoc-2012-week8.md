Eight week of work of GSOC, I've worked on same topics than last week.

Other interpreter implementations compatibility
-----------------------------------------------

Implementations agnostic of low-level functions can be a real nightmare, for example to know where is located the stdlib files. Some corrections and lots of source code read (distutils is not the more understandable stdlib module).

Goatlog reporter
----------------

Goatlog reporter is almost finished, we discussed with [@marmoute](https://twitter.com/marmoute) on how we can improve the user interface, I will try to make a working prototype this week. Json output is currently working so if you want to improve the pylint plugin of your favorite text editor, I will be glad to help you (I already planned to work on Sublime Text 2 plugin).

Afpy camp
---------

Last week-end, there was the Afpy Camp 2012, lots of geeks in the depths of the burgundy. A new this year, we ordered some arduinos stuff and so we had a lot of fun. From led blink programming to remote controlled car (see [tarek blog post](http://blog.ziade.org/2012/07/12/afpy-camp-2012/) for more details about it). I personally have a lot of fun with the keyboard emulation of the Arduino Leonardo board. I was able to launch the Terminal.app and lock the screen. I tried to automatically post a message on facebook wall, but failed. My objective was to reproduce the [github stop light](http://urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/2010/05/19/the_github_stoplight/), but without any network capacities (no wifi chip or ethernet connector) I abandoned the idea.

Thanks a lot to [<http://hackspark.fr>](http://hackspark.fr) & Jon for all the hardware !
