Fourth week of GSOC. Not much work this week, period of project deadline.

Pylint-brain tool
-----------------

Last week, I have presented pylint-brain. One problem with pylint-brain is that you must write modules prototypes by "hand". It should be possible to generate most of the code automatically. Good news, it's possible. If you want to contribute to pylint-brain you can use this piece of code to do the hard work for you:

``` sourceCode
import logilab.astng
import sys

module = __import__(sys.argv[1])
ib = logilab.astng.raw_building.InspectBuilder()
obj_node = ib.inspect_build(module)
print obj_node, obj_node.as_string()
```

See you next week for new adventures.
