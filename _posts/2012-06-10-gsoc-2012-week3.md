Third week of GSOC. I had the opportunity to meet pylint staff, thanks to them for taking some time to answer my questions.

Patches progression
-------------------

Good news, all my patches have been accepted and merged. A new bug-fix release will be released soon with my patches.

Pylint-brain
------------

Sometimes pylint have some problems with dynamic part of python (like hashlib module of python builtin). This is due most of the times to dynamic definition. For more information about this problem, you can read this [blog entry](http://www.logilab.org/blogentry/78354). Why do I speak about it? Because it needs a community effort in order to support full python standard library and external libraries. So the next times you complain about pylint which doesn't get your magically set attributes, please send a patch.

Next work
---------

Until mid-term evaluations, I will work on a maximum of simple tickets. If you want to see a ticket solved, leave a comment and I will try to put it in my todo list.

See you next week for new adventures.
