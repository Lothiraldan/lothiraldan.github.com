That's it, I've got the confirmation yesterday, I'm selected for the Google Summer Of Code 2011. If we ignore the great amount of joy it brought me, it implies that I have to blog more often, so let's begin today.

Today, I'll detail why I chose this project and what the realization of this project will bring to the python community.

Why i chose this project
------------------------

First, because the Quality Assurance subject attracts me. I really love writing software to help developers to improve the quality of theirs own software. That's why I chose this project, what better way to encourage developers to improve quality by making public quality indicators?

Regarding the code, I wrote several little projects (GNU philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together.). So it's a good way to see if my work can be reused by other projects and if so, to finally stop writing software alone and become a real open-source developer. I mean, to begin to contribute to an open-source community because it's different to work alone on a project and to collaborate on a project, this is also why I think the GSOC is a very great thing (even if we forget the rewards and super t-shirt).

Benefits for the community
--------------------------

Let's speak now about benefits for the community. It's simple, if you want to install a distribution, and if you have to choose between two of them, you may choose by using quality indicators (if one have test cases and not the other). It will also be significant if you want to install or use a distribution and if something tell you that this distribution have harmful behavior (like erasing files), you will look closer to the source code instead of install it and test it locally.

I'm really happy to work with Yeswanth SWAMI and all the community, thanks to it, we could divide work into two complementaries parts but independent. Thanks to this preparative work, we have 2 students for working on PYTI this summer, so we can give you a better quality work.

That's it, it's finished, I'll keep you updated on the project.
