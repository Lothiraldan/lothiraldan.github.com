Ninth week of work of GSOC, new release of pylint, logilab-astng and logilab-common.

New releases
------------

The first set of bugs fixes and improvements was released last week. I'm proud to announce the availability of Pylint 0.25.2, ASTNG 0.24 and logilab-common 0.58.1: [<http://www.logilab.org/blogentry/100365>](http://www.logilab.org/blogentry/100365). Pylint should now be compatible with other python implementations, you may encounter false messages on some stdlib modules with pypy. It's actually a bug/flaw of pypy [<https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1164>](https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1164).

Python 3 compatibility
----------------------

The compatibility with python 3 has been ennhanced by not including tests in release processus. In pylint, we have some tests that contain syntax errors and some of them break the installation processus. It means that the next version of pylint will be easily installable via easy\_install or pip.

Some bug fixes
--------------

Bug fixes, again and again. A quick list:

> -   Show only message C0203 (Metaclass method should have "mcs" as first argument) with method \_\_new\_\_ : [<https://www.logilab.org/ticket/4014>](https://www.logilab.org/ticket/4014).
> -   Support of starred node with python 3 (\*a, b = range(5)) : [<https://www.logilab.org/ticket/83138>](https://www.logilab.org/ticket/83138).

See you next week for new adventures.
