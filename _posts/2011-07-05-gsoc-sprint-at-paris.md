Here we go, the PYTI sprint has started today. At the end of the sprint, we should have:

-   A functional task-manager.
-   Some simples tasks (build, install).
-   A VM manager able to launch something.
-   Dependencies computing.

I'm currently working on the task-manager that is close to be functional. In a near future, I'll make a post about how the task-manager works and how you can use it (it's already a draft!). If you want to follow the development, you can watch the PYTI repository: https://bitbucket.org/swamiyeswanth/pyti\_ and the task-manager repository: https://bitbucket.org/lothiraldan/pytasks\_.
