GSOC 2012 has just started last week, so I will try to keep in step this year.

Organisation
------------

For ease my work and ease test of my work for other people, I decided to use a fork of pylint on which each modification will go in a separate branch. I know that mercurial branch are immutables, but each branch will be translated to a patch and repository will be thrown away. It means that if you want to test goatlog integration, you will need to clone <https://bitbucket.org/lothiraldan/pylint-gsoc-2012> and update to branch "goatlog". It's easier than clone the official repository, clone the patch repository and apply the right patch, isn't it?

Work done
---------

### Goatlog interaction

As described [before](http://feldboris.alwaysdata.net/blog/gsoc-2012-im-selected.html), I will work on goatlog interaction and json output.

I've already worked on it and usable. Json output needs to be enhanced, but it's ready for tests. Code is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/lothiraldan/pylint-gsoc-2012/changesets/tip/branch(%22feature-goatlog%22)).

### Bug 7394

I also started to work on pylint tickets for [next release](http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint/0.25.2). The first ticket I work on is [\#7394](http://www.logilab.org/ticket/7394). The ticket is about protected member access. Warning is emitted on access, but not on assignments. Ticket is harder that it seems, I have to separate the proper uses (inside class) and inappropriate uses (outside class).

I've added a test and begin working on implementation. Code is [on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lothiraldan/pylint-gsoc-2012/changesets/tip/branch(%22bug-7394%22)). I'm stuck with assignments classification currently. Any help from ast expert is welcome.

See you next week for new adventures.
