Seventh week of work of GSOC (no blog post for week six sorry, but three blog post without work is quite depressing).

Other interpreter implementations compatibility
-----------------------------------------------

I worked on Jython and Pypy compatibility. The problem affected several different packages, so you will need to wait for next dev version of pylint, logilab-common and logilab-astng, I will warn you when you will be able to test.

Pylint-brain tests
------------------

Did you remember about Pylint-brain? Good news, we add some tests. Why this is a good news? Because if you want to ask about specific stdlib module or some project, just fork [pylint-brain](https://bitbucket.org/sthenault/pylint-brain) and add tests.

Goatlog reporter tests
----------------------

Goatlog reporter is on work. Latest addition of tests enabled us to correct latest bugs, we hope. I hope goatlog reporter will be available in next release of pylint.

Another week of great work on a great project, see you next week for new adventures.
