Second week of GSOC. I have not been able to do as much work I would as I needed to master MQ (and it is not won), understand pylint coding style and understand patch system used.

Ticket 7394
-----------

Second week of work on [ticket 7394](http://www.logilab.org/ticket/7394). Code is now fully functional and related tests are all green. I had to split patch in two, one for functionality and one for extracting common code and make code more readable.

Currently patches need to be reviewed and we need to discuss a specific part of code for checking super() attributes access.

Ticket 18772
------------

I've also worked on another ticket, [\#18772](http://www.logilab.org/ticket/18772). This ticket looks simple, but I was confused about name mangling. I thought that name mangling apply to \_\_init\_\_, but I was wrong. After a short discussion on jabber, I corrected the test and code. Patch is waiting for review.

Next week
---------

Next week I will meet logilab staff and pylint creators, so expect more work to be done after I had been initiated to pylint secrets.

See you next week for new adventures.
